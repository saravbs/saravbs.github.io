Hi, my name is Sara Abbasi.  
Right now, I’m a Federated Learning researcher at Shiraz University under the supervision of Dr. Farshad Khunjush.  

Before this, I worked in Product Management, submitted a patent, and spent a couple of years actively involved in the Computer Science Association as a bachelor’s student at Yazd University. Those experiences, which shaped how I think about both technology and collaboration, continue to influence the way I approach my research today.
 

Outside of work, I love swimming, cycling, hiking, writing, and reading. I’m always exploring different parts of life, trying to figure out what truly feels like “me”.  

I started this blog to share what I’m learning, not just in research and work, but in life too. Writing here is my way of being open, connecting with others, and maybe even making friends who see themselves in these stories—so if you’re curious, reflective, or just enjoy following someone else’s journey, I hope you’ll find something here worth your time :)
