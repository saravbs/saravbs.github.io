Those experiences, which shaped how I think about both technology and collaboration, continue to influence the way I approach my research today.\nOutside of work, I love swimming, cycling, hiking, writing, and reading. I’m always exploring different parts of life, trying to figure out what truly feels like “me”.\nI started this blog to share what I’m learning, not just in research and work, but in life too. Writing here is my way of being open, connecting with others, and maybe even making friends who see themselves in these stories—so if you’re curious, reflective, or just enjoy following someone else’s journey, I hope you’ll find something here worth your time :)\n","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Who Am I and Why Should You Care?"}]
